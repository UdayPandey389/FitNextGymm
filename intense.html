<h2>6 Ways to Increase Your Workout Intensity Without Adding Weight</h2>
<p>When it comes to making process with your exercise routine, especially strength training, what’s one of the top “rules” that you’re told? Usually, 
the first thing someone says is, “I have to increase my weights.”</p>

<p>While that is technically a correct answer and is part of what is referred to as “progressive overload” (subjecting your body to more stimulus
    then it’s capable of at that moment), it’s only one of many options that can be implemented to challenge your body.</p>

<p>In fact, there are times when merely increasing weights isn’t the smart move at all. Maybe you’ve maxed out what you’re able to do, perhaps
you have an injury (or feel one coming on), or perhaps some of the lifts aren’t safe for you to push the envelope by yourself.</p>

<ul>
<li><h2>Shorter Rest Between Sets</h2></li>
<P>This is one of the easiest overall methods to implement while comprised of several different modalities under the same umbrella. Let me lay out a few options for you we use at CK Health & Fitness.
</P>

<li><h2> Picking up the pace on a standard lifting plan</h2></li>
<P>You have your “standard” lifting routine in place, and after you kill each set, you’re supposed to rest 60-90 seconds or 3-5 minutes…whatever the case may be.
</P>
<p>Next time, try decreasing the rest time down 25%-50%. Instead of 60 seconds, your next set starts at 30 or 45 seconds. As I mentioned above, your weights will go down, but the intensity will actually increase.
</p>

<li><h2>Circuit Training</h2></li>
<P>This style of training also plays into the little to no rest between sets approach. In this scenario, you execute a group of exercises back-to-back without rest until you complete that group’s last exercise.
</P>
<P>For example, your first group may be squats, chest press, and pullups. As soon as you finish your squats set, you would immediately perform a set of chest presses, followed by your pullups. Then…after your set of pullups, you would take a rest period before repeating the series or moving onto the next grouping of exercises.
</P>

<li><h2>Supersets/Dropsets</h2></li>

<P>These are two techniques that became really popular with old-school bodybuilding and are still used today. Supersets are simply when you piggyback a set of two exercises with no rest.
</P>

<P>For example, you might do a set of curls, followed immediately with some cable pressdowns.
</P>

<P>Dropsets, on the other hand, consists of a single exercise in which you perform non-stop sets while reducing the weight for each set.
</P>

<P>You might be doing leg presses, and after your first heavy set, drop the weight down by a plate, perform another set, drop the weight again, perform another set. Rinse and repeat.
</P>
