<H2>What is PUSH/PULL/LEGS</H2>

<p>It's a full-body training split that's designed to build muscle in almost every single muscle group by following</p>
<p>a simple format: on a certain day of the week, you only train either </p>
 <p>upper-body pushing muscles (push), upper-body pulling muscles (pull), or your entire lower-body (legs).</p>

<h2>How This Splits LooK</h2>
<ul>
    <h2>
    <li>Day #1, Push: Chest, shoulders, triceps </li>
    <li>Day #2, Pull: Back, traps, biceps </li>
    <li>Day #3: Legs: Legs, glutes and abs</li>
    <li>Day #4, Push: Chest, shoulders, triceps</li>
    <li>Day #5, Pull: Back, traps, biceps</li>
    <li>Day #6, Legs: Legs, glutes and abs</li>
    </h2>
</ul>

<h2>Push, Pull, Legs: An Expertâ€™s Opinion</h2>

<P>
<P>Now that you're au-fait with the push, pull, legs methodology, let's start to unpack what makes</P>
<P>it so popular. "The effectiveness comes from [training] six days a week, </p>
<P>especially if you're bodybuilding, so you can hit the muscle groups more frequently," Hall explains. </p>
<P>"If you're only doing three days a week, the training split allows you to just to focus on certain movement patterns, including using vertical</p>
<P>and horizontal pushes or pulls in the same session and training your posterior and anterior chains in your legs during another session."</p>

<h2>Push, Pull, Legs: The Benefits</h2>

<P>"The major benefit is that PPL is simple. Everything you push, you do on one day,everything you pull, you do on another.</P>
<P>Everything with your legs, you do with 
another," Hall explains. "It categorises movement properly, too, so that you think </p>
<P>about movement over muscle groups."</p>
