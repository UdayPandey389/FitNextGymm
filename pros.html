        <ul>
            <li>If you're already huge and strong, your muscles will take between 4-6 days to recover from training. Therefore, training each muscle group once a week is likely ideal.
            </li>
            <li>You get to train 5 days a week, which many lifters enjoy.
            </li>
            <li>Many lifters enjoy the idea of dedicating an entire workout to a specific muscle/muscle group.
            </li>
